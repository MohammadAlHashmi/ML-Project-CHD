# ML-Project-CHD
Coronary Heart Disease, CHD, is the leading cause of death, representing 11% of all deaths in 2001, according to the 
WHO Global Burden of Disease study. CVDs caused an estimated 17.9 million deaths globally in 2019, making it the leading 
cause of death. In this paper we attempt to correlate a set of features that may be associated with CHD using the 
Cardiovascular Study Dataset available on Kaggle. The prediction was achieved by applying machine learning techniques 
which included decision trees, K-nearest neighbor, Naive bayes and both Linear and nonlinear SVM. An analysis was made on 
the algorithms using accuracy, confusion matrix and roc curve. Based on results, the Decision Tree Classifier yielded the 
highest accuracy of 72.25%.
